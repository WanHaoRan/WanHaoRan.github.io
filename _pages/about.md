I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University. I am working with Professor [Wei Wang](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/ww/).

My recent research focuses on building acoustic sensing and human-device interaction systems on mobile devices (smart phone, smart speaker, VR/AR, etc.).
